                Hello there! I'm Kabute Grace, a passionate student on a mission to explore the endless possibilities of coding and technology, constantly seeking new ways to bring ideas to life through code. When I'm not diving into lines of code, you'll often find me seeking solace in the beauty of nature, marveling at its wonders and finding inspiration in its simplicity. I find joy in the simple pleasures of life, savoring the flavors of a home-cooked meal And of course, no day is complete without a dose of laughter, courtesy of a good movie that never fails to lift my spirits.
